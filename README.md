# How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I think the principles of object-oriented programming are an important part of writing maintainable and adaptable code. Having the components of the application in a modular architecture makes future changes and debugging a much easier process. Readability comes down to commenting in my opinion. Proper commenting allows for easier understanding of complex pieces of software for more than just the original author. 

# How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist?
Firstly, I like to identify the problem and break it down into smaller problems to solve. I would then iterate over potential solutions for each of these problems. Depending on the circumstances, I would also review feedback whenever possible. 

# How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses?
I generally stick to a similar strategy of problem solving when it comes to the projects and assignments, I have worked on at SNHU. I like to break the templates down into smaller pieces and chip away at a steady pace. The only variables I consider are the tools at my disposal and what the intended outcome of the project is. 

# What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?
One strategy that I think would always make the process of creating databases for clients easier is to understand the tooling ecosystem and work off your client's needs. For example, is the data being stored better in a SQL or NoSQL database? What will you be doing with the data? How will you scale the system? Each technology has pros and cons, and being able to find the right fit is a crucial skill to fulfilling client requests. 

# What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter?
Computer scientists are responsible for the design, implementation, and maintenance of company systems and databases. For a company that maintains a large database with high query traffic, a computer scientist can work to optimize query performance and aggregate necessary data pipelines such as daily sales analytics or pattern recognition. Additionally, computer scientists can be responsible for scaling the database as well as security and general maintenance. Overall, a computer scientist can be responsible for the creation, maintenance, and adaptation of the company database.
